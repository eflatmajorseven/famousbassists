			<p>Hey there, I'm gonna be open here. The reason
			this site exists is because I'm taking a Web Developement 
			course and I need to create a website. Since I couldn't
			think of something interesting, I came up with a plan to make a page of something I like. Bass guitar. Welcome aboard and have a nice read.  </p>

				<h2><span>James Jamerson</span></h2>
		<p>James Jamerson anchored the Motown rhythm section, expanding the possibilities for bass players with hit after hit after hit, all while remaining mostly anonymous, because session players were rarely credited on Sixties Motown recordings. “James Jamerson became my hero,” Paul McCartney once said, “although I didn’t actually know his name until quite recently.” When Jamerson started his career, the bass was largely seen as a utilitarian support instrument; most players stuck to “stagnant two beat, root-fifth patterns and post–’Under the Boardwalk’ clichéd bass lines,” according to Standing in the Shadows of Motown: The Life and Music of Legendary Bassist James Jamerson. Jamerson helped revolutionize the field, jolting his parts with extra syncopation, additional chords that added melodic depth and complexity, and tonal choices that evoked gospel harmony. His list of contributions to iconic records is impossible to sum up quickly, but his key Motown recordings include the Temptations’ “My Girl,” which surely has one of the most recognizable, instantly gratifying bass parts in all of pop; Gladys Knight’s “I Heard It Through the Grapevine,” where he plays a suave, bubbly counter to the jittery piano; and Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On,” which finds Jamerson at his hyper-melodic best. “James went a step beyond what bassists normally do,” explained Bob Babbitt, who also played bass on several What’s Going On tracks. “At first he took chances and let himself go, and then it just became natural for him, and in the process he changed the course of bass playing. </p>

		<h2><span>Jaco Pastorius</span></h2>
		<p>“My name is John Francis Pastorius III, and I’m the greatest bass player in the world.” That was Jaco Pastorius’ opening line to Joe Zawinul when he met the Weather Report keyboardist backstage at a 1974 Miami show. Zawinul scoffed at the time, but he wasn’t laughing a few years later, once Pastorius had joined the group and helped turn them into bona fide fusion superstars. Jaco’s 1976 self-titled debut, where he played high-speed bebop with ease and dazzled with chiming harmonics, set a new standard for electric-bass virtuosity; joining Weather Report the same year, he thrilled audiences with his signature fretless sound and cocky flair, and forever banished the notion that bass was a background instrument. As flashy a player as he was, he was also a stellar collaborator: From the mid-Seventies through the Eighties — preceding his tragic death at age 35 — Pastorius’ revolutionary four-string approach was a perfect match for everyone from Pat Metheny to Jimmy Cliff, and especially Joni Mitchell’s increasingly adventurous songwriting on albums like Hejira. “[I]t was as if I dreamed him, because I didn’t have to give him any instruction,” Mitchell once said of Jaco. “I could just kind of cut him loose and stand back and celebrate his choices.”	</p>

		<h2><span>Marcus Miller</span></h2>
		<p>A modern master of the electric bass, Marcus Miller has been landing dream gigs for the best part of 40 years. Since his heady introduction to the New York studio scene in the mid-70s, he has worked with a who’s who of R&B and pop superstars including the likes of Luther Vandross, George Benson, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Eric Clapton, Al Jarreau, Paul Simon, Whitney Houston, Jay Z and Chaka Khan. His passion for jazz and instrumental music has also landed him gigs with some of the biggest names in jazz from Herbie Hancock and McCoy Tyner to Wayne Shorter, Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis.
As if all these achievements weren’t enough, Marcus has also forged a solid solo career, formed a bass supergroup with Stanley Clarke and Victor Wooten, and made a name for himself as a producer, arranger and multi-instrumentalist. He’s written for film too, including soundtracks for the 1992 Eddie Murphy film Boomerang, The Great White Hype starring Samuel L Jackson and Obsessed starring Beyonce Knowles. You have to ask yourself… is there anything Marcus Miller can’t do?!	</p>
